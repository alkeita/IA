SPECIAL TOPICS CHAIRWhat Swarm Robotics?
 In nutshell, swarm robotics (SR) basically large number robots mimicking insects animals gather act 
together collective ants bees. 
 Historically, robots swarm robotics identical, preferably small. This homogeneous model.
 Today call extensions heterogeneous 
model.  We will discuss tutorials.Why?
 The cross section large ant hill solid dome structure passage ways air vents ( try checking tenants still intact, will yield unhappy 
outcomes, particularly fire ants). 
 Dome shape one enforced structures. 
Another perk dome shape, rains, rain 
trickles instead flooding habitat holes. Scientists intrigued long time seemly simple creatures can construct something intelligent. Why?  (con’t)
 Moreover, communicate complete task? Who decides ? 
 The ant hill just one amazing feat ants, also weave ants join bodies together can float water, escape flood. This weave carries ants rotate formation drown. This social behavior distributed collective intelligence. The ants demonstrated society sum far parts. 
 If can recreate ability group simplistic 
robots, opportunities endless.Don’t We Multi-agent s Already?
 Yes, historical definition (homogenous) swarm robotics comes clarify .
 The original intent introducing swarm robotics separate research meant address need large 
numbers small, cheap robots moving working together swarm. This includes ability perform physical formation like weave ants. 
 Robots expected simplistic cheaper can mass produce; large numbers acts 
like nodes internet - destruction single 
point/section will annihilate swarm.It’s Family…
 SR Multi-agents (MAS). MAS predecessor swarm, way Distributed AI (DAI) predecessor MAS.
 MAS mainly multiple robots 
working together. It created foundation communication, coordination, task planning, distributed agent frameworks.
 SR needs scale potentially thousands robots. 
Many old MAS algorithms support large 
numbers address robot physical formation. 
 However, another branch robotics – modular robotics, tackling .Architectures
 Swarm systems trace heritage Blackboard systems 
(DAI). Each robot designer may add architecture framework. The following used swarms:
 Deliberative Reasoning Architecture (sense, think, react) – layered, top- approach
 Reactive Architecture (sense, react) – horizontal decomposition. Modules work parallel
 Hybrid architecture – combines deliberative reactive architecture. It comes three 
kinds style:
1. Managerial 
 Much like deliberative task allocation layer. Top level higher planning, pass next layer, refines decomposes pass forth. 
The lowest level reactive. This information passed upward, may readjust task commands. Each layer tries resolve issues will request help parent layer resolve issue.
2. State hierarchies
 Able identify activities reactive deliberative – reactive activity state.
3. Model-oriented
 More top managerial. They manipulate global world model. The global world 
model acts virtual sensor provide perception behaviors.Types Robots Used
1. Reconfigurable robots
Today, trend merging evolutionary algorithms robot 
hardware, particularly seen “reconfigurable modular 
robots”[3][32][33][34][12][13], may also called “evolutionary robots” “self 
assembly robots”. Basically, robots consists modules, , response environment, stimuli, simulated pheromones [9], may 
reconfigure reason - getting around obstacle. Richard 
Beck[3] explained typical physical requirements robots:
 Shape - must uniform. This makes easier reconfigure perform self repair. It also helpful shapes optimized physical structures wiring can easily included
 Mechanical – keep , keep simple. Also, lightweight. The connections modules must tight yet easily connected disconnected.
 Electrical – electrical components required power. However, components, actuators, mandatory enables robot linear rotational movements. 
Furthermore, many actuators modular robots (bigger degree freedom), power 
consumption actuator must efficient.Types Robots Used (con’t)
2. Miniature (swarm) robots
Some miniature robots include following: Sandia Laboratory created dime size robots [25] mimic swarm insects. Stoeter Pananikolopoulos created “jumping robot” [3]. Physical requirements:
 Mechanical – similar full size robot just smaller version. Exact items depends robot designed
 Electronic – similar full size robot just smaller version.
 Sensors – It can surprisingly large small scout. It can include magnetometers, 
accelerometers, camera, video transmitter, microphone, vibration sensors forth.
 Communications – usually wireless, analog.
 Computational System - generally minimal. Due size, carry much 
computation power .
 Power - low consumption.Types Robots Used (Con’t)
 Sensors – depends robot used .
 Communications – There three types communication – intra-module (within module), inter-modules ( n modules) global. The communication types 
can wired wireless.
 Power – The board battery must able support robot least hours various configurations robot.
 Computation system – Aside required handling communication, 
sensors, forth, modular system also require distributed control software enough memory buffered communication. Furthermore, since robots modular, system must allow designers add new modules. Hence, interface 
support new modules included.Issues
 Issues sensor fusion
Petriu et al [29] list following issues sensor fusion: 
communication delay randomness different sensor agents.
 Issues miniature robots
According Stoeter[5], 
miniature robots 10cm less able powerful 
computer board. 
miniature robot generally lacks reliable communication links. This robots generally run low power sources, turn 
can support low power transmitters. These transmitters powerful, thus run problems transmitting data receiving control instructions central control.Environment Programming Languages
There many Robotic Development Environments 
currently available. We list just :
 ARTIS [14]: real time agent architecture develop agent.
 OROCOS [30]: modular framework robot machine 
control
 IDEA [31]: framework planning execution agents
 ROCI [36]: framework support distributed sensors actuators.
 CLARAty [15]: framework generic reusable 
components robotsDeployment Consideration
Some consideration issues brought Chong et al [4] 
regarding following issues deployment utilization robots:
Programming robots tedious overwhelming task average programmer.
The complexity, dynamical, unstructuredness environment 
also makes difficult pre-determine code.
Large amount knowledge required reasoning
Intelligence knowledge centralized robot controller.
Some issues addressed robotic learning. REFERENCES
